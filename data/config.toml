Welcome to `rotmg`! 

To link your in-game and Discord accounts, you will go through a verification process. Make sure you have access to your RealmEye account before you start! 

In order to be verified, you must meet the following requirements:
```diff
+ Public RealmEye profile
+ Public RealmEye name history
+ Public RealmEye graveyard
```

Once you click the button below, you will start verification. No sensitive info you send to the bot will be saved!

If you completed verification but did not get a role or a nickname, contact a staff member to have it set manually.

Have fun, and happy raiding!
